# Dazza Greenwood, On Agents

I'll be collecting and sharing my thoughts, and some new work, on LLM-based agents here at [OnAgents.org](https://onagents.org). 

This is very much a work in progras and I'll be adding content to this site for awhile.

Here is my tentative outline of major content categories:

1 [Background Materials](background/)

2 [Codename Agento](agento/)

3 [Design Patterns](patterns/)

4 [Principal Authority](principals/)

5 [Agent Transactions](transactions/)

6 [New Value](genspring/)

### NOTE:

# HTML, CSS, JS (Auto Refresh)

This template is a starter for building a website with HTML, CSS and JS, powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). HTML provides the basic structure, CSS controls formatting, and JavaScript controls the behavior of different elements.

Hit run to see this project in action. It will auto-refresh as you edit the HTML, CSS and JS files.

#### Disable Auto Refresh

If you find the auto refresh getting in your way, go to [vite.config.js](./vite.config.js) and update it set `hmr` to false to disable hot module reloading (HMR). The full config will look like this:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [],
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    hmr: false, // Change this line to `false` disable auto-refreshing.
  }
})
```

#### Packages

Because this template uses Vite to build your code, you can add install and use npm packages. Simple open the Packager tool to search and manage your packages.
